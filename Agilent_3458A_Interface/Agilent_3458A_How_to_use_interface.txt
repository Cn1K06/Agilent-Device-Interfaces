# before interface is initialized, mess device should be connected with a lan cable and opened!!

# lan connection can be checked by commanding in terminal as:
ping 172.17.2.21 


# The file path containing the Python file must be opened in the terminal.

# then to start the interface, command in terminal :
sudo python3 interface_telnet.py

# if the number of readings will be used then use 2nd python file
# since the code should be arranged with respect to number of readings.
sudo python3 interface_telnet2.py


# it will automatically start interface
# initially identity is declared, status cleared and instrument resetted.
# it is asked if calibration should be performed or not
# if yes then select a type of calibration.
# all calibration time is about 16 Min, DC is for 3 Min, AC is for 3 Min, and OHM is for 12 Min.

# After calibration is done, there is no more connection between mess device and raspberry pi
# so exit the interface and the lan cable should be unplug and plug again.
# Start interface  by commanding in terminal again:
sudo python3 interface_telnet.py

# then for the calibration question, it should be commanded as no then
# measurements can be done by writing one of the commands:  dc, ac, curr_dc, etc 
# they are listed after python file initialized.

# measuruments can be stopped while measuring by writing command 
stop

# then it will be asked to save the measurement or not 
# if it is yes, measurements are saved, file name and format should be written together to save the measurement data. For example:
dc_voltage.txt
# Measurument is saved with respect to UTC time and measurument type.
# For Instance:
Time,AC Voltage
