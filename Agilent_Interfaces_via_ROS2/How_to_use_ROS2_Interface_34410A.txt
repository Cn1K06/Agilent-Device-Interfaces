########### How to Use the ROS 2 Interface of the Agilent 34410A Measurement Device ###########

# If 'colcon build' has already been completed, there is no need to run it again.

# If not, the following operations should be performed in the terminal within the workspace environment  
# (e.g., the terminal should display something like: ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~/agilent_34410a_ws)

colcon build  

# Then:
source install/setup.bash  

# Now you can run the node with the following command:
ros2 run agilent_34410a_interface agilent_34410a_node6  

# The node prints the identity of the measurement device, resets the instrument, clears its status,  
# and then asks the user what type of measurement should be performed.

# The user can select from several options: dc, ac, curr_dc, curr_ac, res, cap, etc.  
# Assume "dc" is selected:
dc  

# The node will then begin printing DC voltage readings.  
# The measurement can be stopped by typing the following command in the terminal:
stop  

# After stopping, the node asks whether the measurements should be saved:
yes  

# If the answer is "no", the measurements will not be saved.  
# If the answer is "yes", the user is prompted to enter a filename:
dc_voltage  

# Then, the user is asked to specify the file format:
txt  

# The measurements are then saved in a file inside the ROS 2 workspace.

# The node can be exited by typing the following command in the terminal:
exit
