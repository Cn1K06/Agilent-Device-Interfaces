########### How to use ROS2 Interface of Agilent 34410A measurement device #############
# If colcon build is already done, it is no needed to be done again.
# if not; These operations should be done in terminal and in workspace environment (that means it should be written in terminal as ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~/ros2_ws).
colcon build --packages-select agilent_cpp_34410a
# then.
source install/setup.bash
# now we can run our node in terminal.
ros2 run agilent_cpp_34410a agilent_34410a_node4
# node prints identity of the measurement device and asks user what type of measurement should be done.
# user can select dc, ac, curr_dc etc. Assumed here dc is selected.
dc
# then node start to print dc voltage, it can be stopped by commanding stop in terminal.
stop
# then node asks to user whether measurements are saved or not.
yes
# if answer is no they are not saved.  If yes, then first filename is written by user .
dc_voltage
# then file format is written .
txt
# after that measurements are saved in ros workspace in a file.
