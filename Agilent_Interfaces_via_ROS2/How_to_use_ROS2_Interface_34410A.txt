########### How to use ROS2 Interface of Agilent 34410A measurement device #############
# If colcon build is already done, it is no needed to be done again.

# if not; These operations should be done in terminal and in workspace environment (that means it should be written in terminal as ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~/agilent_34410a_ws).
colcon build 

# then.
source install/setup.bash

# now we can run our node in terminal.
ros2 run agilent_34410a_interface agilent_34410a_node6

# node prints identity of the measurement device, instrument reset and clear status and  then asks user what type of measurement should be done.

# user can select dc, ac, curr_dc, curr_ac, res, cap etc. Assumed here dc is selected.
dc

# then node start to print dc voltage, it can be stopped by commanding stop in terminal.
stop

# then node asks to user whether measurements are saved or not.
yes

# if answer is "no", the measurements are not saved.  If yes, then first filename is written by user.
dc_voltage

# then file format is written.
txt

# after that measurements are saved in ros2 workspace in a file.

# Node can be exited by commanding exit in terminal
exit
