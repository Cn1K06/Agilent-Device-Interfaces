########### How to use ROS2 Interface of Agilent 3320A measurement device #############
# If colcon build is already done, it is no needed to be done again.

# if not; These operations should be done in terminal and in workspace environment (that means it should be written in terminal as ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~/agilent_3320a_ws).
colcon build 

# then.
source install/setup.bash

# now we can run our node in terminal.
ros2 run agilent_3320a_interface agilent_3320a_node6

# node prints identity of the measurement device, instrument reset and clear status and  then asks user what type of wave should be created.
# user can select sin, square, ramp, pulse etc. Assumed here ramp is selected.
ramp

# then node asks user frequency, amplitude and symmetry to create ramp wave
enter frequency (Hz): 

# then 
enter amplitude (Vpp) :

#after that
Enter symmetry (0-100%):


# for each type of wave, requirements are different
# for a Sin Wave; frequency and amplitude
# for a Square wave; frequency,amplitude and duty cycle 
# for a Ramp wave; frequency, amplitude and symmetry 
# for a Pulse wave; frequency, amplitude, pulse width and edge time
# for a Noise ; amplitude
# for a Arbitrary wave ; frequency, amplitude and arbitrary waveform points
# for a Sweep; start frequency, stop frequency,sweep time and sweep type
# for a burst; carrier frequency, carrier amplitude, number of cycles per burst, burst period and  trigger source

# Node can be exited by commanding exit in terminal
exit
