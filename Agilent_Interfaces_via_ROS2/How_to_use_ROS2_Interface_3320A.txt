########### How to Use the ROS 2 Interface of the Agilent 33220A Measurement Device ###########

# If 'colcon build' has already been run, it does not need to be executed again.

# If not, the following operations should be done in the terminal, inside the workspace environment
# (e.g., the prompt should look like: ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~/agilent_3320a_ws)

colcon build  

# Then:
source install/setup.bash  

# Now, you can run the node using the following command:
ros2 run agilent_3320a_interface agilent_3320a_node6  

# The node prints the identity of the measurement device, resets the instrument,
# clears its status, and then asks the user what type of waveform should be created.

# The user can select from various waveform types: sin, square, ramp, pulse, etc.
# Assume "ramp" is selected:
ramp  

# The node will then ask for the required parameters:
Enter frequency (Hz):  
Enter amplitude (Vpp):  
Enter symmetry (0â€“100%):  

# Required parameters vary depending on the waveform type:

# For a Sine wave: frequency, amplitude  
# For a Square wave: frequency, amplitude, duty cycle  
# For a Ramp wave: frequency, amplitude, symmetry  
# For a Pulse wave: frequency, amplitude, pulse width, edge time  
# For Noise: amplitude  
# For an Arbitrary wave: frequency, amplitude, arbitrary waveform points  
# For a Sweep: start frequency, stop frequency, sweep time, sweep type  
# For a Burst: carrier frequency, carrier amplitude, number of cycles per burst, burst period, trigger source  

# The node can be exited by typing the following command in the terminal:
exit
