# Agilent 53132A measurement device should be connected via lan cable to the Raspberry pi and can be connected via a cable to the Agilent 3320A  
# Agilent 53132A GPIB code should be at 22. It can be arranged in front panel menu via Utility menu.

# The file path containing the Python file must be opened in the terminal.
# then to start the interface, command on terminal :
sudo python3 interface.py


# The file path containing the Python file must be opened in the terminal
# then to start the interface, command in terminal :

sudo python3 interface_telnet.py

# it will automatically start interface
# initially identity is declared, status cleared and instrument resetted

# Measurement types are listed after python file initialized. (FREQ/PER/DCYC/PWID/NWID/RTIM/FTIM/RATIO/CONFIGURATE/LIST/MATH/EXIT) 
# They can be done by writing one of these commands:   etc. Assumed here: FREQ
FREQ
# here it is asked which channel is cable plugged in. Whatever cable is connected to should be selected. Assume channel 1:
1
# Then, it is asked what type of measurement mode, single/continuous. Assume:
continuous
# press Control + C to stop measurement. Then, it is asked to user whether retrive statistics yes/no:
yes
# type of statistics (mean/stddev/min/max):
mean

# However statistics operations cannot be executed here.
# Also, the operations in the math menu cannot be performed remotely. Code should be updated or these operations can be performed from the front panel. 


# interface could be exited by commanding in terminal:
exit
