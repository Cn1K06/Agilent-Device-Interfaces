# The Agilent 53132A measurement device should be connected via LAN cable to the Raspberry Pi.  
# Optionally, it can also be connected via a cable to the Agilent 33220A.  
# If the interface is used on Ubuntu 24.04, run the following command in the terminal before using the interface (or if there is an error about "No route to Host/Device").
sudo ip addr add 172.17.2.100/24 dev eth0

# The GPIB address of the Agilent 53132A must be set to 22.  
# This can be configured from the front panel via the Utility menu.  

# The terminal must be opened in the directory containing the Python file.  

# Then, to start the interface, enter the following command in the terminal:  
sudo python3 Agilent_53132A_interface.py  

# This will automatically start the interface.  
# Initially, the device identity is queried, the status is cleared, and the instrument is reset.  

# After initialization, the available measurement types are listed:  
# (FREQ / PER / DCYC / PWID / NWID / RTIM / FTIM / RATIO / CONFIGURATE / LIST / MATH / EXIT)  
# A measurement can be started by entering one of these commands. For example:  
FREQ  

# Then, the interface asks which channel the cable is connected to.  
# Enter the channel number (e.g., if the cable is connected to channel 1):  
1  

# Next, the measurement mode is requested: single or continuous. For example:  
continuous  

# To stop the measurement, press **Control + C**.  
# After stopping, the user is asked whether to retrieve statistics:  
yes  

# Then, the desired type of statistics is requested (mean / stddev / min / max). For example:  
mean  

# Note:  
# Statistical operations cannot currently be executed remotely.  
# Likewise, the operations in the MATH menu cannot be performed via the interface.  
# These functionalities must either be added to the code or performed directly via the front panel.  

# The interface can be exited by typing:  
exit
