# before interface is initialized, mess device should be connected with usb cable and opened!!

# usb connection can be checked by commanding in terminal as:
lsusb
# then it will show the usb connected devices.
# if usb tools are not installed in ubuntu, it can be installed as:
sudo apt install usbutils 

# The file path containing the Python file must be opened in the terminal
# then to start the interface, command in terminal :
sudo python3 interface.py

# it will automatically start interface
# initially identity is declared, status cleared and instrument resetted

# Measurement types are listed after python file initialized. 
# They can be done by writing one of the commands:  dc, ac, curr_dc, etc. Assumed here:
dc
# measuruments can be stopped while measuring by writing command 
stop

# then it will be asked to save the measurement or not 
# if it is yes, measurements are saved, file name and format should be written together to save the measurement data. for example;
dc_voltage.txt
# Measurument is saved with respect to UTC time and measurument type.
# For Instance:
Time,AC Voltage
