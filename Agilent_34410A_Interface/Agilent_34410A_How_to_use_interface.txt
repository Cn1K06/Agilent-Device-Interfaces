# Before the interface is initialized, the measurement device should be connected via USB and powered on!

# The USB connection can be checked by entering the following command in the terminal:  
lsusb  
# This will display the connected USB devices.  
# If the USB tools are not installed on Ubuntu, they can be installed with:  
sudo apt install usbutils  

# The terminal must be opened in the directory containing the Python file.  
# Then, to start the interface, run the following command:  
sudo python3 interface.py  

# This will automatically start the interface.  
# Initially, the device identity is queried, the status is cleared, and the instrument is reset.  

# After the Python file is initialized, available measurement types are listed.  
# A measurement can be started by entering one of the commands, such as:  
ac  

# Measurements can be stopped at any time by typing the command:  
stop  

# The interface will then ask whether to save the measurement.  
# If the answer is yes, the user must enter the filename and format (e.g.,):  
ac_voltage.txt  

# The measurement is saved with respect to UTC time and the selected measurement type.  
# For example:  
Time,AC Voltage

exit
