# The measurement device should be connected via USB to the Raspberry Pi and with a cable to the oscilloscope.  
# The file path containing the Python file must be opened in the terminal.  
# Then, to start the interface, enter the following command in the terminal:  
sudo python3 interface.py  

# This will automatically start the interface.  
# Initially, the identity is queried, the status is cleared, and the instrument is reset.  

# After the Python file is started, the user is asked which signal will be generated.  
# Measurements can be done by entering one of the following commands:  
SIN / SQUARE / RAMP / PULSE / NOISE / ARB / MODULATION / SWEEP / BURST  

# If a sine wave is selected, the user is asked:  
Enter frequency (Hz):  

# Then:  
Enter amplitude (Vpp):  

# The interface then prints in the terminal:  
Sine wave configured.  
Output enabled.  

# For other waveforms, the following information is requested from the user:  
# For a square wave: frequency, amplitude, duty cycle  
# For a ramp wave: frequency, amplitude, symmetry  
# For a pulse wave: frequency, amplitude, pulse width, edge time  
# For noise: amplitude  
# For an arbitrary wave: frequency, amplitude, arbitrary waveform points  
# For a sweep: start frequency, stop frequency, sweep time, sweep type  
# For a burst: carrier frequency, carrier amplitude, number of cycles per burst, burst period, trigger source  

# If modulation is selected, the user is asked which type of modulation is to be used:  
AM / FM / PM / FSK / PWM  

# Then, the corresponding parameters are requested via the terminal. For example, for amplitude modulation:  
Carrier waveform (SIN / SQUARE / RAMP)  
Modulating waveform (SIN / SQUARE / RAMP / TRIANGLE / NRAMP)  
Carrier frequency  
Carrier amplitude  
Modulating frequency  
Depth  

# Each parameter is asked one by one.  
# PWM requires only a pulse carrier waveform, so the user does not select a carrier waveform. It is automatically chosen.  
# FSK does not have a modulating waveform. If FSK is selected, the modulating waveform is not requested.  

# The interface can be exited by typing the following command:  
exit
