without # ==> means command in terminal

# Mess device should be connected via usb to the Raspberry pi and with a cable to the oscilloscope
# The file path containing the Python file must be opened in the terminal.
# then to start the interface, command on terminal :
sudo python3 interface.py

# it will automatically start interface
# initially identity is declared, status cleared and instrument resetted. 

# After the Python file is started, the user is asked which signal will be generated.
# measurements can be done by writing one of the commands: 
SIN/SQUARE/RAMP/PULSE/NOISE/ARB/MODULATION/SWEEP/BURST 

# If sin wave is selected, then it is asked to user:
enter frequency (Hz): 

# then 
enter amplitude (Vpp) :

# then interface prints in terminal:
sin wave configured.
output enabled.

# For other waves the following information are requested from user
# for a Square wave; frequency,amplitude, duty cycle 
# for a Ramp wave; freqeuncy, amplitude, symmtery 
# for a Pulse wave; frequency, amplitude, pulse width, edge time
# for a Noise ; amplitude
# for a Arbitrary wave ; frequecy, amplitude, arbitrary waveform points
# for a Sweep; start frequency, stop frequency,sweep time, sweep type
# for a burst; carrier frequency, carrier amplitude, number of cycles per burst, burst period, trigger source

# If modulation is to be made, the question is what type of modulation will be made.
AM/FM/PM/FSK/PWM

# Then, their features should be given also in terminal for example for Amplitude Modulation
carrier waveform (SIN/SQUARE/RAMP)
modulating waveform (SIN/SQUARE/RAMP/TRIANGLE/NRAMP)
carrier frequency
carrier amplitude
modulating frequency
depth

# each one is asked one by one
# PWM requires only pulse carrier waveform. So user doesn't choose a carrier waveform. It is automatically selected.
# FSK has no modulating waveform. If FSK is selected, it is not asked modulating waveform.

# interface could be exited by writing command
exit
